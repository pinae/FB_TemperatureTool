## Compiling and Flashing
Please use PlatformIO for development. This plug-in for VSCode is much more convenient than the infamous Arduino IDE. If you are new to the software: There is a small arrow to the right in the blue bar at the bottom of the VSCode window. If the Arduino is attached this button will automatically compile the source code and transfer it to the microcontroller.
